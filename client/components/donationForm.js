            For over sixty two years the Hillery Memorial Scholarship Foundation
            has enabled young men of Bishop-Timon St. Jude High School to
            receive financial aid to help support their decision to seek a
            Franciscan based education.The continued support of the community
            has provided over $1,000,000 in financial aid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally this is the time of year when we would be inviting you to
            the annual event that shares in celebrating Timonâ€™s recognition of
            alumni and friends who give their gifts and talents to further the
            Best that is Western New York. But, because of Covid-19, this is far
            from a normal year.Covid-19 has had a serious negative impact on the
            economy including many of our Timon families and students. Now more
            than ever there is a need for your continued support.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year we are instead hosting the Scholarship Supporters
            Sweepstakes, giving you the chance to support the students, and
            maybe win some money in the process!
